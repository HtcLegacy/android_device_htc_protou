# Desire X port of CyanogenMod 11

Hi there. I'm trying to port @weritos / @Y300-0100's CyanogenMod 11 for Optimus L7II (vee7) to HTC Desire X (protou). Wish me luck. If you wish to contribute make a fork or pull request and I'll merge it. I'm not entirely sure if this is going to work or whether I'm capable of this, so let's see. Any help is much appreciated, as I don't have a huge amount of experience with Android development in particular
